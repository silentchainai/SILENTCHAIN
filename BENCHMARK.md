## Contributing Benchmarks

If you'd like to contribute benchmark results:

1. Run SILENTCHAIN on a public vulnerable application (DVWA, Juice Shop, WebGoat, etc.)
2. Document your test environment:
   - SILENTCHAIN version
   - AI provider and model
   - Target application
   - Hardware specs (CPU, RAM)
   - Network conditions
3. Export benchmark report from SILENTCHAIN
4. Submit via GitHub Issue or Pull Request

## Notes

- All benchmarks are performed on **publicly accessible test applications** designed for security testing
- Results may vary based on:
  - AI model version and capabilities
  - Network latency
  - Hardware resources
  - Target application complexity
  - Burp Suite configuration
- For **Ollama** benchmarks: Local hardware significantly impacts performance
- For **Cloud AI** benchmarks: Network latency and API rate limits affect results
